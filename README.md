# How to Noodle
This repository will explain how to make a noodle map with some basics described and with a provided script.

# Getting Started
This repository uses a [Wiki](https://github.com/StormPacer/How-to-Noodle/wiki) to make things more organized. Have fun!


# Map Scripts
Some mappers leave their scripts on the internet and thus allowing other mappers to take a look understand how things were made.
Here are some examples of scripts:
- [TzurS11](https://github.com/TzurS11/NoodleScript/tree/main/Examples/Scripts) 
- [StormPacer](https://github.com/StormPacer/Noodle-Maps)
- [Totally Balloon](https://github.com/Infinit3/le-monke-maps)
