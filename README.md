# How to Noodle
This repository will help explain how to make a noodle map in Beat Saber, with some basics described and a provided script included.
# Getting Started
This repository uses a [Wiki](https://github.com/StormPacer/How-to-Noodle/wiki) to make things more organized. Have fun!
# Map Scripts
Some mappers leave their scripts on the internet and thus allowing other mappers to take a look and understand how things were made.
Here are some examples of these scripts:
- [StormPacer's Noodle Maps](https://github.com/StormPacer/Noodle-Maps)
- [Totally Balloon's le monke maps](https://github.com/Infinit3/le-monke-maps)
- [TzurS11's NoodleScript](https://github.com/TzurS11/NoodleScript/tree/main/Examples/Scripts)
