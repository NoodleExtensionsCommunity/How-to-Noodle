# How to Noodle
This repository will explain how to make a noodle map with some basics described and with a provided script.

# Getting started
**YOU NEED NODE.JS FOR THIS TO RUN!**

The tutorial for it in vscode can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial).

It is recommended to grab my script before starting to learn how to script in this.

If you run into any issues message me on discord (StormPacer#2871)

If you see me use `Random()`, note it's already incorporated into the script, thank you Reaxt for the original script, it can be found [here](https://github.com/Aeroluna/NoodleExtensions/tree/master/Documentation/examples/documentationMap).

# Folders
Each folder has It's own little category in which everything is described. Have fun learning, if you want something added or contribute to this, open a pull request, an issue or message me on discord.
