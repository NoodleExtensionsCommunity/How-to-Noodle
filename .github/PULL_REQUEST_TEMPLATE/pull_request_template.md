# Thank you for making a PR to our repo!

We have some rules for the Pull Request.

1. A Pull Request has to have some sort of meaning. This means you cannot submit a Pull Request that does basically nothing.
2. A Stale Pull Request will be considered abandoned, and be closed. The timeframe for this is 1 week.
3. First time contributors will have to explain exactly *why* their Pull Request should be merged. <br> This should always be done regardless if you're a first timer or not.
